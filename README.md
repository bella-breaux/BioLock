# BioLock
A smart wallet with biometric access.

Sensors used in this project were the: Nano Arduino, a fingerprint sensor, a solenoid lock, and a piezo speaker. Using SolidWorks, we 3D printed the case for the wallet to accommodate these components. Using the C++ and the fingerprint sensor library, our team registered our fingerprints. When an unauthorized individual attempted to gain access to the wallet by scanning their finger, BioLock remained securely engaged, while the piezo speaker played a sad tune. When one of my team members scanned one of their pre-registered fingerprints, the smart wallet would open and play a happy chime.
